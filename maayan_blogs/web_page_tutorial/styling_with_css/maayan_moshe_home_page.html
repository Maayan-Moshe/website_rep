			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>There is nothing better than finding original, simple and unique solution to a new problem. Learning new fields and finding out of the box solutions is what I do.
			I am mathematician, physicist and software developer by this order. I am enthusiastic about applying mathematics to real life problems relating seemingly non-connected fields.</p>

			<h3>Experience</h3>
			
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Sr. Technical Manager, Algorithms, Product Innovation</strong>, <i>Align Technology</i>, January 2015 - present</dt>
					<dd><p>Developing and implementing algorithms in computer vision and 3D geometry. 
						Including stitching algorithms for surfaces (embedded in 3D), calibration of 3D scanner, automatic detection and measurements of spheres and planes in 3D scene, etc..
						Responsibility for integration and mitigation of algorithms to other teams in production, quality assurance, application, etc..</p>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Algorithm Researcher Consultant</strong>, <i>Align Technology</i>, July 2013 - January 2015</dt>
					<dd><p>Developing and implementing algorithms in computer vision and inertial measurement units. 
					Some of the research stage was done in Python and the software implementation I did in C++.</p>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Co-founder</strong>, <i>Causequence</i>, July 2012 - present</dt>
					<dd><p>an Israeli high-tech company specializing in causality based analytics. 
					Utilizing my knowledge in machine-learning and computational statistics I have developed 
					unique patent-pending technology which can be used primary to explain and manipulate users behavior in websites and mobile applications. 
					I implemented the software in C#, SQL Server, and XAML.</p>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Quantitative Analyst, Fixed Income - Corporate Solutions</strong>, <i>BNP Paribas</i>, 2010 - 2012</dt>
					<dd><p>Corporate and Investment Banking, Fixed Income, Corporate Solutions I advised corporates on optimizing their 
						ﬁnancial position using various ﬁxed income instruments with the help of statistical methods, derivative pricing and corporate ﬁnance. 
						I developed various computational models for this purpose, including:
						<ul>
							<li>Derivative pricing methods using Merton model to identify the best features for new debt issuance.</li>
							<li>Monte Carlo methods to quantify beneﬁts and risks of issuing inﬂation-linked debt.</li>
							<li>Historical comparison between ﬁxed income derivatives price and realized interest rate.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>I implemented the models in C# and VBA.</p>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Researcher</strong>, <i>Hewlett-Packard</i>, 2010 - 2010</dt>
					<dd><p>Researcher and Algorithm Developer, Hewlett-Packard, Indigo Division I developed automatic algorithms for recognizing failures, 
					utilizing my knowledge in computational statistics and mathematical probability and my understanding of the physical processes in the printing machine. 
					I initiated, designed, and developed a software based on Bayesian networks for automated modeling of machines. I implemented the software in C#.</p>
					</dd>
				<dt><strong>Researcher</strong>, <i>Tel Aviv University</i>, 2005 - 2010</dt>
					<dd><p>Assistant, Tel Aviv University, Condensed Matter Department Research in theoretical superconductivity, 
					including extensive use of analytical and numerical methods for partial differential
					equations. During this time, I developed software package for simulating various superconducting devices. 
					I implemented the software in C++ and Matlab.</p>
